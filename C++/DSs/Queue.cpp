/*I've seen on the internet that they do it using arrays. I did it using linked lists. Here are my conclusions:
Using arrays:
    Pros: Easy to implement. Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.
    Cons: It is not dynamic. It doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime.
    Insertion time = O(1)

Using LinkedLists:
    Pros: The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
    Cons: Requires extra memory due to involvement of pointers.
    Insertion time = O(n), if we use tail it could drop to O(1), but we'd have to use even more memory cuz
        we'd have to use double pointer.
